        <h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
    
        <p>JavaScript is an exciting programming language that allows us to make computers do all sorts of things. Let's get started by understanding the basics of JavaScript:</p>
        
        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>Computers can only do what we humans tell them to do. They can't do anything without programs. We tell computers how to behave using computer programs, which are a set of instructions for the computer to follow. Computers cannot understand human languages like English. Instead, we write computer programs in programming languages like Python and JavaScript.</p>
        
        <h3>Where Have You Seen JavaScript?</h3>
        <p>You might be surprised to learn that you've already encountered JavaScript on the internet! Many websites use JavaScript to create interactive and fun experiences. For example, have you ever played simple games on websites? Games like the one here: <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/cube-slam" target="_blank">Cube Slam</a>. These games are often powered by JavaScript!</p>
        
        <h3>JavaScript for Interactivity</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a fantastic tool for making websites interactive. It allows us to create dynamic web pages where things can change, respond to your actions, and even talk to other parts of the web. It's like giving websites a brain!</p>
        
        <h3>Try It Yourself!</h3>
        <p>Let's do a quick hands-on demonstration. Open the console in your Chrome browser by right-clicking on the webpage, selecting "Inspect," and then going to the "Console" tab. Type the following code and press Enter:</p>
        
        <pre><code>console.log("Hello World, I'm learning JavaScript");</code></pre>
        
        <p>You should see a message printed in the console. This is JavaScript in action!</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding JavaScript Syntax and Comments</h3>
        <p>JavaScript has its own set of rules for writing code, known as syntax. We'll explore these rules in more detail as we go along. Additionally, we can add comments in our code. Comments are notes we leave for ourselves or others to understand our code better. They are not executed by the computer and are very useful for explaining what our code does.</p>
        
        <p>Stay tuned for more lessons!</p>

        <h2>Lesson 2: Exploring Data Types and Variables</h2>
    
        <h3>Recap on What We Have Learned</h3>
        <p>In our previous lesson, we got a glimpse of what JavaScript is and how it works. Now, it's time to take a closer look at some fundamental concepts in JavaScript.</p>
        
        <h3>Practice: Solving Math Problems with JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Let's roll up our sleeves and solve some fun math problems together using JavaScript. You can follow along in your browser's console:</p>
        
        <h4>1. Addition</h4>
        <pre><code>
        let sum = 9 + 8;
        console.log("The sum of 9 and 8 is " + sum);
        </code></pre>
        
        <h4>2. Subtraction</h4>
        <pre><code>
        let difference = 10 - 4;
        console.log("The difference between 10 and 4 is " + difference);
        </code></pre>
        
        <h4>3. Multiplication</h4>
        <pre><code>
        let product = 6 * 7;
        console.log("The product of 6 and 7 is " + product);
        </code></pre>
        
        <h4>4. Division</h4>
        <pre><code>
        let quotient = 20 / 4;
        console.log("The quotient of 20 divided by 4 is " + quotient);
        </code></pre>
        
        <p>These exercises will help kids get comfortable with basic arithmetic operations in JavaScript. As we continue our journey, we'll explore even more exciting concepts!</p>

        <h2>Lesson 3: Exploring Data Types and Variables</h2>
    
        <h3>Data Types</h3>
        <p>Data is information that we store in our computer programs. Think of it as the details we keep in our programs, like your age, your name, and many other things. In JavaScript, we have different data types to represent different kinds of information:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>String:</strong> Used to represent text. For example: "Hello, Friend"</li>
            <li><strong>Number:</strong> Used to represent numeric values, including whole numbers and decimals. For example: 5, 3.142</li>
            <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> Used to represent true or false values. For example: true or false</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>JavaScript Variables</h3>
        <p>In JavaScript, we use variables to store and manage our data. Think of variables as labeled jars where we can keep different things. Let's learn more about them:</p>
        
        <h4>Variable Naming Rules</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Variable names should start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).</li>
            <li>After the first character, variable names can also include numbers.</li>
            <li>Variable names are case-sensitive; "age" and "Age" are different.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Variable Scopes</h4>
        <p>Variables have different scopes, which determine where in your code they can be accessed. We'll dive deeper into this concept later.</p>
    
        <h4>Variable Declarations: let, var, const</h4>
        <p>In JavaScript, you can declare variables using keywords like <code>let</code>, <code>var</code>, or <code>const</code>. Here are some examples:</p>
    
        <pre><code>
        let age = 9; // a number
        let name = "Your name"; // text
        let ILoveMyMom = true; // true or false value
        </code></pre>
    
        <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>Let's practice! Try creating some variables to store your name, age, and whether you like ice cream or not. Remember, practice is important for mastering programming.</p>
    
        <h3>Homework</h3>
        <p>For homework, write JavaScript code to solve simple math problems and experiment with variables. This will help reinforce what we've learned in today's lesson.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson-content" id="lesson-4-content">
        <h2>Lesson 4: Type Casting</h2>
        <p>We covered data types in JavaScript and how to create variables to store different kinds of data. Next, we will talk about type casting.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding Type Casting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Type casting or type conversion is changing the data type of a value from one type to another.</li>
            <li>Type casting is useful when you need to perform operations or comparisons between values of different types.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Implicit Type Casting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript can automatically convert data types in certain situations. For example, when you add a number to a string, JavaScript may implicitly convert the number to a string and perform concatenation.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
            let num = 5;
            let str = "Hello, ";
            let result = str + num; // conversion to string
            console.log(result); // "Hello, 5"
        </code>
    
        <h3>Explicit Type Casting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can also explicitly change the data type using functions or operators or methods like <code>parseInt()</code>, <code>parseFloat()</code>, and <code>String()</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
            let strNum = "42";
            let num = parseInt(strNum); // convert to integer
            console.log(num); // Outputs: 42
        </code>
        
        <h4>More Examples:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>String to Number - <code>parseInt()</code> or <code>parseFloat()</code> to convert strings to numbers</li>
            <code>
                let strNum = "42";
                let num = parseInt(strNum);
            </code>
            <li>Number to String - <code>String()</code> to convert numbers to strings</li>
            <code>
                let num = 42;
                let strNum = String(num);
            </code>
            <li>Boolean to Number: <code>true</code> value can be converted to <code>1</code> and <code>false</code> value to <code>0</code></li>
            <code>
                let isTrue = true;
                let num = Number(isTrue); // 1
            </code>
        </ol>
    
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Convert a string representing a number into an actual number and perform a mathematical operation</li>
            <li>Convert a number into a string and concatenate it with another string.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Lesson 5: Control Flow: Conditional Statements</h2>
        <h3>Recap on Type Casting</h3>
        <p>We covered type casting and how to change the data type of values in JavaScript. Next, we're going to dive into a powerful concept that allows our programs to make decisions: conditional statements.</p>
        
        <h3>What Are Conditional Statements?</h3>
        <p>Conditional statements are like decision-making tools in programming. They allow our programs to make choices and take different actions based on certain conditions.</p>
        
        <h4>if...else Statements</h4>
        <p>Explain `if` statements and their structure. Show examples of `if` statements and explain what is happening:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let age = 10;
                if (age >= 13) {
                    console.log("You are a teenager.");
                } else {
                    console.log("You are not a teenager.");
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Explain to the kids what this program does.</p>
        
        <p>Introduce `else if` and provide examples. Conduct exercises on `if...else` and ask kids to write simple programs to reinforce their understanding, such as determining if a given number is odd or even.</p>
        
        <h4>Switch Statement</h4>
        <p>Introduce the `switch` statement and explain its structure:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let day = "Monday";
                switch (day) {
                    case "Monday":
                        console.log("It's the start of the week.");
                        break;
                    case "Friday":
                        console.log("It's almost the weekend!");
                        break;
                    default:
                        console.log("It's an ordinary day.");
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Conduct exercises using the `switch` statement, such as creating a program to determine if a given day is a school day or not.</p>
        
        <h4>Homework</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Write JavaScript code that checks if a user's age is between 13 and 19 and prints "You are a teenager" if true.</li>
            <li>Create a program that asks the user for their favorite color and responds with a message based on their input.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Lesson 6: Loops and Iterations</h2>
        <h3>Recap on Conditional Statements</h3>
        <p>We learned about conditional statements, which allow our programs to make decisions. Next, we'll explore another essential programming concept: loops. Loops allow us to repeat actions and perform tasks more efficiently.</p>
        
        <h3>What is a Loop?</h3>
        <p>A loop is like a recipe that tells the computer to do something over and over again.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Loops</h3>
        <h4>for Loop</h4>
        <p>Explain the structure of a `for` loop:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
                    console.log("Hello, Friend");
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>What's happening in the above loop? Conduct exercises on `for` loops.</p>
        
        <h4>while Loop</h4>
        <p>Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true. Explain the structure of a `while` loop:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let counter = 1;
                while (counter <= 5) {
                    console.log("Hello, Friend!");
                    counter++;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>In the above example, the `while` loop continues as long as `counter` is less than or equal to `5`. Conduct exercises on `while` loops.</p>
        
        <h4>do while Statement</h4>
        <p>Explain what a `do while` loop is and provide an example:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let num = 1;
                do {
                    console.log("Hello, Friend!");
                    num++;
                } while (num <= 5);
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>Conduct exercises on `do while` loops.</p>
        
        <p>Explain the use of `break` and `continue` statements in loops. Give practical use cases of loops, such as iterating through arrays, generating patterns, user input handling, and automating repetitive tasks.</p>
        
        <h3>Practice Loops</h3>
        <p>Show examples of how loops can be used to create patterns like a square. Challenge kids to use loops to create their favorite patterns.</p>
        
        <h3>Homework</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Write JavaScript code that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for` loop.</li>
            <li>Create a program that asks the user for a number and uses a `while` loop to count down from that number to 1, printing each count.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson-content" id="lesson-7-content">
        <h2>Lesson 7: Functions</h2>
        <p>Functions are a fundamental part of JavaScript programming.</p>
        
        <h3>What Are Functions?</h3>
        <p>Functions are like recipes that perform specific tasks in a program and create reusable pieces of code. They are essential in programming because they allow us to organize and reuse code efficiently.</p>
        
        <h3>Creating Functions</h3>
        <p>Explain how to create a function using the `function` keyword and provide simple examples that kids can relate to:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                function sayHello() {
                    console.log("Hello, World. I'm learning JavaScript");
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Calling Functions</h3>
        <p>Show kids how to call or use a function and provide an example:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                sayHello();
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <h4>Exercise</h4>
        <p>Let kids create different functions that do different tasks. For example, create a function that takes a name as a parameter and greets the person using their name.</p>
        
        <h3>Function Parameters and Return Values</h3>
        <p>Introduce function parameters and return values to kids.</p>
        
        <h4>Function Parameters</h4>
        <p>Explain how to pass data into a function using parameters and provide an example:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                function greet(name) {
                    console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <h4>Return Values</h4>
        <p>Explain how functions can return values and provide examples:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                function add(a, b) {
                    return a + b;
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>Functions can do many things, including calculating numbers, drawing pictures, playing sounds, and moving objects on a screen. One superpower of functions is that they let you reuse code, making your programs more efficient.</p>
        
        <h4>Exercises</h4>
        <p>Create exercises for kids to practice functions. For example, create a function that takes a birth year as a parameter and returns the age.</p>
        
        <h3>Homework</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Write a function called `singSong` that prints out the lyrics to your favorite song. Call the function to sing your song!</li>
            <li>Provide additional homework exercises for them to practice functions further.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="lesson-content" id="lesson-8-content">
        <h2>Lesson 8: Function Scope</h2>
        <p>In this lesson, we'll explore how variables work within functions, the concept of hoisting, and the idea of function scope.</p>
        
        <h3>Local Variables</h3>
        <p>Explain local variables, which are variables defined inside a function and only accessible within that function. Provide examples to illustrate local variables:</p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                function calculate() {
                    let x = 10;
                    console.log(x);
                }
            </code>
        </pre>
        
        <h3>Global Variables</h3>
        <p>Mention global variables and their availability throughout the program. Highlight the difference between local and global scope and show examples of global variables.</p>
        
        <h3>Practice</h3>
        <p>Create a function that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Use local variables for calculations to demonstrate function scope.</p>
        
        <h3>Function Expressions</h3>
        <p>Explain function expressions and how to create functions as expressions. Provide an example of a function expression:</p>
